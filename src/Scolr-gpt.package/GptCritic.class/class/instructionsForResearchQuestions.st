  ^'Formulate specific research questions that your review aims to answer. These questions should be focused and directly related to your objective. They will guide your search and analysis. Research questions in a systematic literature review should be actionable. Actionable research questions are specific, well-defined, and provide clear guidance for your review process. Actionable questions typically include the following characteristics:
* Clarity: They are formulated in a way that leaves no room for ambiguity. Anyone reading the question should have a precise understanding of what you are trying to investigate.
* Specificity: Actionable questions are focused on a particular aspect of your topic. They avoid being overly broad and help you target your search and analysis.
* Feasibility: The questions should be answerable with the available resources and within a reasonable time frame. They should not be too complex or require extensive data collection.
* Relevance: They are directly related to your research objectives and the purpose of your systematic review.
* Testability: You should be able to test or examine the questions using the available literature. This is crucial for assessing the research gaps and synthesizing findings.'.
