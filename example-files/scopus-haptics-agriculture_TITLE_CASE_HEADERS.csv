We face many problems when we do not have a feedback from robots. In this research paper, we are discussing all possibilities to achieve complete closed loop system for Multiple-DOF Robotic Arm, which is used in a coconut tree climbing and cutting robot by introducing a Haptic device. We are working on various sensors like tactile, vibration, force and proximity sensors for getting feedback. For monitoring the robotic arm achieved by graphical user interference software which simulates the working of the robotic arm, send the feedback of all the real time analog values which are produced by various sensors and provide real-time graphs for estimate the efficiency of the Robot. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agricultural robotics; force feedback; haptics",Conference Paper,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030321773

Recently, meshless methods (MLM), which inherit many advantages of finite element method (FEM) and yet need no explicit mesh structure to discretize geometry, have been proposed as an attractive alternative to FEM for solving engineering problems where automatic re-meshing is needed. This paper offers an adaptive MLM (automatically inserting nodes into large error regions) for solving contact problems. We employ the sliding line algorithm with the penalty method to handle contact constraints; it does not rely on small displacement assumptions and thus, it can solve non-linear contact problems with large deformation. Along with three practical applications, we validate the method against results computed using commercial FEM software and analytical solutions. © 2007 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36349010811
