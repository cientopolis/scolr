"ICT supported extension services in conservation [::agriculture::] information access for small holder farmers in Laikipia County, Kenya","A. J. Cox; H. Sseguya","2015","This paper examines how Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are used in the Conservation [::Agriculture::] (CA) knowledge pathways. It discusses the parallel knowledge pathways smallholder farmers' use to access conservation [::agriculture::] information. The objective of this study is to develop an effective dissemination model that exploits the use of ICTs in existing pathways in order to improve Conservation [::Agriculture::] knowledge flows. Design, Methodology and Approach: A total of one hundred and twenty-five respondents were interviewed, with a purposively selected sample of 110 CA farmers interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Using the snowball method, 15 key informant interviews were conducted with Policy makers and ICT service providers. 69% of the respondents were female and 51% male. The focus of the study was on the different ICTs used in the CA knowledge pathways, the dissemination pathways, institutional and socio-economic factors. Data was analyzed manually and using SSPS ver. 21. Preliminary findings indicate that a variety of knowledge pathways exist through which farmers can access CA knowledge. Four different kinds of ICT led models were identified, Government ICT led models, Government-NGO led models, Government-NGO-Private Sector ICT led model and NGO ICT led models. However the study notes a lack of harmonization and weak linkages between institutions in the utilization of the existing ICT models, utilization of the ICTs access and ownership at the household level and harmonization of the CA messages. Furthermore, even though there was 100% mobile phones ownership, 94% radio, 64% television, 10% Laptop and 9% Computer (desktop) access and ownership among the respondents, farmers and a large number of the extension staff lacked the skills to fully exploit the use of these tools to access CA knowledge. Implication: New emerging and existing communication technologies have a very high potential to improve agricultural knowledge flows if taken advantage of by the ""change agents"" in the diffusion process of new innovations. New online technologies known as Web 2.0 and `social media' are slowly emerging as platforms for collaboration, sharing of product and market information. Open chain models of village information centres also provide numerous economic opportunities, and do also network communities while providing public/private services. The opportunity of using real time communication tools has been greatly embraced especially by the youthful farmers and the advantage of these new emerging tools is their unique attributes, similar to the traditional oral cultures of communication seen in the African social systems where one can see, hold a discussion, get immediate feedback and use the written media to convey messages. The high percentage of ownership and accessibility of ICTs among the survey population also offers the potential to fully exploit ICTs in the improvement of the CA knowledge pathways and agricultural information provision.","10.1109/ISTAS.2015.7439408","IEEE Conferences"

"CDS project - what is inside","R. Hoad","2004","CDS stands for Community Directory Service. The generalized idea of the CDS means that a community of people/experts on the Internet accumulate and screen information and links found on the Internet and place into a dynamically growing directory (topics with subtopics or subject tree) overseen, structured and controlled by editors who have taken the responsibility to look after the content and structure. Everything is done decentrally through the Internet but on a central server (server group). At the beginning of 2000 the CDS project set out to develop a community of practice Web site for fisheries researchers, so known later as ""OneFish"". The software was rapidly taken up by a number of other FAO customers mainly interested in building thematic hierarchical portals, metadata catalogues and collaborative work group sites. These customers included WCA-Infonet, a global platform for decisions on water conservation and use in [::agriculture::]. As a consequence of the expansion the software requirements evolved rapidly and in unexpected ways. This presentation outlines the history of the project, how the problem of evolving requirements was tackled, how the requirements shaped the software architecture and the software development method employed.","10.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307661","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards enabling tacit knowledge externalization using mobile phone: The case of participatory agricultural innovation in Ethiopia","G. Semeon; M. Garfield; M. Meshesha","2015","Mobile technology has huge potential to address challenges in the areas of tacit knowledge elicitation, capturing, sharing and integration in participatory agricultural innovation where farming communities are actively involving. Past studies emphasized the behavioral and managerial perspectives of tacit knowledge and limited studies have been conducted from ICT perspective. Those ICT related studies focused more on advanced technologies including Web 2.0, [::groupware::], audio &amp; videoconferencing tools which are beyond the reach of the rural communities. The purpose of this study is therefore, to identify various mechanisms of tacit knowledge elicitation and sharing in participatory agricultural research process and explore how mobile based application can enhance the process. The output of the study will contribute to the development of mobile-enabled communication system that can further enhance participatory agricultural innovation through facilitating articulation, capturing, sharing and integration of tacit knowledge of multiple stakeholders including farmers.","10.1109/AFRCON.2015.7332021","IEEE Conferences"

"General requirements to design mobile shared workspaces","V. Herskovic; S. F. Ochoa; J. A. Pino; A. Neyem","2008","Traditionally, collaborative systems have been difficult to conceive, design and implement. Although several requirements involved in these products are recurrent, some become invisible to clients and developers because they are part of the product back- end. This situation is worse in the case of mobile [::groupware::] because the general requirements to support mobile collaboration are still unclear. This paper presents a framework of general requirements that are usually present in mobile shared workspaces. These requirements are not always visible; therefore the framework acts as a checklist helping developers to consider them. Thus, the framework could increase the success probability of mobile shared workspaces.","10.1109/CSCWD.2008.4537043","IEEE Conferences"

"A framework for collaborative, adaptive and cost sensitive intrusion response system","A. J. Ikuomola; A. S. Sodiya; J. O. Nehinbe","2010","In recent years, the security issues on computer networks have become one of the primary concerns because the pervasiveness of computer technology has rendered computer networks to be more vulnerable to attacks than ever before. It is necessary to take corrective actions in the process of detecting surreptitious attacks to ensure proper safety of the entire system. However, effective post-intrusive actions depend on integrated efforts of experts and systems and a thorough understanding of intrusion detection processes. Therefore, this work aims to strike a balance between damages made by the intrusion and cost of response. Cost-Sensitive modeling approach will be used so as to define the cost factors involved. The prototype of the design is briefly discussed.","10.1109/CEEC.2010.5606485","IEEE Conferences"

"Value Chain Creation through Digital Innovation: The Ebb and Flow of Communality and Connectivity in a Networked Interorganizational System","K. Guth; M. S. Poole","2015","Communality and connectivity are types of public goods offered in online spaces. As theoretical concepts, they provide design insight for the creation and understanding of interorganizational collaboration tools in multisided networks and value chains. In this paper, we present an extension of communality and connectivity that enables an examination of how organizations create value with networked organization-to-organization (O2O) systems. We use the framework as a lens for a case study involving the historical development of an online technology and its organization (MarketMaker) over 16 years that reframed the backbone of the agricultural market in the U.S. From a supply chain to a network. MarketMaker successfully interwove consumers, farmers, universities, government agencies, and states based on its innovation to connect stakeholders in novel ways around information and communication. As a central system in reconfiguring the value chain, MarketMaker provided services to the food industry not previously enabled. A number of important lessons learned about effective use of communality and connectivity are discussed.","10.1109/HICSS.2015.502","IEEE Conferences"

"An objective function for performance measurement of human-robot target recognition systems in unstructured environments","A. Bechar; Y. Edan; J. Meyer","2004","Robotic systems for unstructured environments need to cope with rapid changes in time and space, inherent uncertainty, and generate unpredictable and dynamic situations, resulting in lack of information, due to inadequate sensor accuracy and computational limitations. Introduction of a human operator (HO) into the system can help simplify the robotic system and ensure improved performance. In the current study we developed an objective function for different levels of HO-robot collaboration in a target recognition task. The objective function considers several HO and robot parameters, which contribute to the overall performance in each level of collaboration. Results indicate that HO-robot collaboration improves system performance in many conditions. The optimal collaboration level depends on image complexity and on robot and HO characteristics. Some of the latter have to be assessed through behavioral research on HOs.","10.1109/ICSMC.2004.1398284","IEEE Conferences"
"CMC and the question of democratisation: a university field study","D. Cecez-Kecmanovic; L. Treleaven; D. Moodie","2000","The potential of computer mediated communication (CMC) to enable new forms of social interaction and foster democratisation of decision making has raised much interest but has been challenged by contradictory research results. Conceived as a tool, CMC was examined in terms of its social effects, thus indicating a degree of technological determinism. We explore CMC as an extension of a productive social space of linguistically-mediated interaction, drawing on J. Habermas's (1984; 1987) theory of communicative action. By examining the evidence from a field study of a university, we identify how participants appropriate CMC to produce a consultative discourse motivated by divergent agendas. This investigation helps us better understand communicative practice and concurrent tendencies of CMC towards encouraging and obstructing democratisation.","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926590","IEEE Conferences"
"A Collaborative Task Modeling Approach Based on Extended GOMS","L. Liang; X. Deng","2009","Usability evaluation is traditionally used in the late stage of software development process. However, to some high-cost complex distributed collaborative software, such late-usability-evaluation or single-user-oriented usability inspection are unsuitable in modern situation. The early stage of evaluation always relies on a task model (interface model) to simulate the actions of real user. However, the existing task analysis models neither provide enough support to the high-level use-context, nor address the low-level description of the basic unit of collaborative behavior (such two level factors always have great effect on the usability of collaborative software). Thus, this paper analyzed the limitation of the traditional GOMS method, and then put forward a task modeling approach based on GOMS to fit usability evaluation in collaborative environment. This approach cost less, and is easy to be applied in the early development stage to discover and modify usability problems.","10.1109/ICECT.2009.88","IEEE Conferences"

"Intelligent knowledge sharing for agricultural information","C. J. Kolte; A. Shrivas","2017","In collaborative environments, users may try to acquire required similar information on the Web in order to gain knowledge in one domain. For example, in an organization several departments may successively need to buy business intelligence software and employees may have studied online about different business intelligence tools and their features independently. It will be beneficial to get them connected and share learned knowledge. We investigate fine-grained knowledge sharing in collaborative environments. A two-step framework is proposed for mining fine-grained knowledge: (a) Web surfing data is clustered into categories by a non-parametric generative model; (b) a Support Vector Machine model is developed to mine fine-grained aspects in each task. Finally, the classic expert search method is applied to the mined results for knowledge sharing. Web surfing Agricultural data is collected to show that the fine-grained aspect mining framework works as expected and outperforms baselines. The search accuracy improves significantly when it is integrated with expert search, in comparison with applying the classic expert search method directly on Web surfing data.","10.1109/ICOEI.2017.8300906","IEEE Conferences"
